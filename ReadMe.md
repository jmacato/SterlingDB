# Sterling NoSQL OODB #

Sterling is a lightweight NoSQL object-oriented database for .NET Core 3.1 that works with your existing class structures. Sterling supports full LINQ to Object queries over keys and indexes for fast retrieval of information from large data sets.

The goal behind Sterling is to keep it:
  - Non-intrusive. You shouldn't have to change your classes just to persist them. (No awkward mapping from a class model to a relational database model).
  - Lightweight. As of this writing, the total memory footprint of Sterling is under 100 Kb. No one needs to bloat their project for something as simple as persisting data.
  - Flexible. While the core is light, Sterling is designed to handle any serialization task and make it ultra-easy to query databases using LINQ-to-Objects.
  - Portable. Sterling runs well on platforms that support .NET Core 3.1.
